					It is best to use proliferators to boost products on more complex/end materials.
					Most time using proliferators on speed are better, but a few end materials are better at product.
					
					It is best to use proliferators to boost products on complex/end materials, while boosting speed on the lower stages.
					This mix helps reduce the factory size from the upper stage, while helping being UPS friendly on the lower stage.

						Although you might tweak things to speed to reduce the scale of other industries.
						For example particle broadband on products, even though speed is most optimal, to reduce need on chemical plants & oil refineries.
