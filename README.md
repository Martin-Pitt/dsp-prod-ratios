This [Dyson Sphere Program](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1366540/Dyson_Sphere_Program/) calculator helps figure out how to scale up your factory lines.

Based on needs like how much you want to produce or how many buildings you want because of available space.

Enter your research progress first to avoid spoilers and convenience.

## Why?

I wanted a tool to help me scale up my factory and address bottlenecks.

But existings tools were:
- Way too complex
- No cohesive UX in mind
- Awkward due to being adapted factorio tools; DSP has a very different playstyle
- Incomplete and/or out of date

I wanted to:
- Prioritise production per minute/second or how many buildings
- Have a familiar visual design
- Have adjacent tools/documentation
- Use it on my mobile while playing
